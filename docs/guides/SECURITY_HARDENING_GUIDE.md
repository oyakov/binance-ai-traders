# Security Hardening Guide for High-Grade Protection

## Purpose
This guide outlines the technical controls, operational practices, and verification steps required to elevate the Binance AI Traders platform to a high grade of security readiness. The recommendations align with industry frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS Controls v8, ISO/IEC 27001) and focus on securing the microservice architecture, trading workloads, developer tooling, and supporting infrastructure.

## Security Objectives
1. **Confidentiality** – Safeguard API keys, trading strategies, and customer data through encryption, segregation, and controlled access.
2. **Integrity** – Prevent unauthorized modification of code, configurations, data streams, and trade execution logic.
3. **Availability** – Ensure resilient services, continuous monitoring, and tested recovery procedures to minimize downtime.
4. **Regulatory Alignment** – Map controls to financial trading compliance obligations and align with MEM-C005 infrastructure guardrails.

## Architecture Risk Surface
- Multi-language microservices (Java Spring Boot, Python FastAPI) with Kafka, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis (planned).
- Secrets required for Binance APIs, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Telegram bot, and monitoring stack.
- Multiple Docker Compose environments (dev/testnet/prod) with shared yet distinct configurations.
- Integration of automated trading algorithms with external market data sources.

## Hardening Pillars

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Enforce Single Sign-On (SSO) with MFA for all operational platforms (Git provider, CI/CD, observability, infrastructure dashboards).
- Implement least-privilege IAM roles per service (e.g., Kafka producers/consumers, PostgreSQL schemas) and codify them in Terraform or Ansible.
- Adopt short-lived credentials using OIDC federation for CI pipelines; eliminate long-lived access keys.
- Introduce just-in-time access for production environments with auditable approval workflows.
- Maintain centralized secrets vaulting (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or GCP Secret Manager) with envelope encryption.

### 2. Secrets Management
- Prohibit plaintext secrets in Git. Configure pre-commit scanners (git-secrets, truffleHog) and integrate checks into CI.
- Store Binance API keys and private certificates in the vault; provide application access via dynamic secrets or mounted volumes with restricted permissions.
- Rotate secrets every 90 days or immediately after compromise, with automated rotation scripts referenced in `scripts/`.
- Encrypt environment files (e.g., `testnet.env`) using Mozilla SOPS or age and restrict decryption keys to authorized personnel.

### 3. Infrastructure & Network Security
- Segment environments (dev/testnet/prod) using isolated VPCs or Kubernetes namespaces with separate security groups.
- Implement zero-trust networking: mutual TLS for service-to-service communication and network policies that default deny all ingress/egress except required ports.
- Harden Docker hosts: enable automatic OS patching, CIS benchmark profiles, FIPS 140-2 compliant crypto libraries, and kernel auditing (auditd).
- Introduce Web Application Firewall (WAF) and API gateways with rate limiting and geo-blocking for public endpoints (FastAPI/Telegram webhooks).
- Enable Kafka authentication (SASL/SCRAM or mTLS) and ACLs for all topics; enforce TLS 1.2+ encryption in transit.
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanners (tfsec, checkov) and container scanners (Trivy, Grype) in CI to detect misconfigurations.

### 4. Application Security
- Integrate static application security testing (SAST) for Java (SpotBugs, SonarQube) and Python (bandit, semgrep) into CI pipelines.
- Enforce dependency vulnerability scanning via OWASP Dependency-Check (Java) and `pip-audit`/`poetry audit` (Python).
- Adopt secure coding standards: input validation, output encoding, strict typing, and robust error handling as outlined in MEM-010.
- Implement runtime protections: Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for UI portals, strict origin checks for webhook handlers, and CSRF protection for authenticated APIs.
- Conduct threat modeling per service (STRIDE/LINDDUN) before major releases; document outputs in `docs/reports/`.

### 5. Data Protection
- Encrypt PostgreSQL data at rest using cloud KMS-backed disk encryption or transparent data encryption (TDE).
- Apply field-level encryption for sensitive attributes (API keys, user identifiers) and use columnar hashing for anonymized analytics.
- Configure Elasticsearch with TLS, role-based access control (RBAC), and audit logging; disable dynamic scripting unless required.
- Implement Kafka topic retention policies and secure data purging aligned with regulatory retention requirements.
- Maintain secure backups: encrypted, immutable storage with tested restore procedures and separation from production credentials.

### 6. Monitoring, Detection, and Response
- Centralize logging in ELK or Loki, enriching entries with correlation IDs already recommended in `docs/AGENTS.md`.
- Deploy SIEM rules for anomaly detection (e.g., unusual trade volumes, repeated auth failures) and integrate alerting with PagerDuty or Opsgenie.
- Instrument services with Prometheus metrics and configure Grafana alerts (see `docs/GRAFANA_ALERTS_SETUP.md`) for security-relevant signals.
- Enable host intrusion detection (Falco, OSSEC) for container runtime monitoring and integrate results into SOC workflows.
- Establish an incident response playbook covering detection, triage, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review.

### 7. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)
- Define security gates in CI/CD: code review with security checklist, automated scans, and policy-as-code (Open Policy Agent, Conftest).
- Provide developer training focused on secure coding, secrets handling, and threat awareness.
- Maintain an asset inventory (services, dependencies, infrastructure) and map to MEM-C003 architecture documentation for traceability.
- Run quarterly tabletop exercises to validate incident response and change-management workflows.
- Adopt supply-chain security controls: signed commits (GPG/SSH), verified provenance (SLSA level 2+), and artifact signing (Cosign).

### 8. Compliance and Governance
- Map controls to applicable regulations (e.g., MiFID II, SOC 2) and maintain evidence in a dedicated compliance repository.
- Conduct regular risk assessments and document mitigation plans in `docs/reports/` with MEM references.
- Implement change management with ticketing integrations, approval workflows, and auditable logs.
- Schedule annual third-party penetration testing and remediate findings within agreed SLAs.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Phase 0 – Assessment (Weeks 1-2):** Inventory assets, evaluate current state against this guide, prioritize gaps, and assign owners.
2. **Phase 1 – Foundations (Weeks 3-6):** Deploy secrets vault, enforce MFA/SSO, enable TLS across services, and integrate SAST/DAST scanners.
3. **Phase 2 – Defense-in-Depth (Weeks 7-12):** Implement network segmentation, IaC security pipelines, runtime monitoring, and automated backups.
4. **Phase 3 – Validation (Weeks 13-16):** Conduct penetration tests, red-team exercises, and disaster recovery drills; capture lessons learned.
5. **Phase 4 – Continuous Improvement (Ongoing):** Review control effectiveness quarterly, update documentation, and incorporate new threats.

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All secrets managed centrally with rotation policies and no plaintext credentials in repositories.
- [ ] MFA enforced for all administrative interfaces and privileged accounts.
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ enabled for internal and external communications, including Kafka, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and FastAPI.
- [ ] Vulnerability scans (SAST, DAST, dependency, container) running in CI/CD with gating policies.
- [ ] Logging, monitoring, and alerting integrated across infrastructure and applications with on-call escalation.
- [ ] Backup, recovery, and incident response plans documented, tested, and reviewed quarterly.
- [ ] Regular third-party security assessments scheduled and remediation tracked to completion.

## Maintenance
- Review this guide quarterly or after major architectural changes (referencing MEM-C004 and MEM-C005).
- Track implementation status via security scorecards and update `docs/reports/` with current posture metrics.
- Align security backlog items with milestone plans (M1/M2) to ensure readiness for testnet and production launches.
