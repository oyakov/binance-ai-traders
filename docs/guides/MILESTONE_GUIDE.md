# Binance AI Traders - Milestone Guide

## Project Progression Roadmap

This guide outlines the strategic progression from backtesting validation to production deployment, ensuring systematic validation and risk management at each stage. It now incorporates the growth roadmap defined in *Crypto Trading System: Strategies for Growth and Roadmap to Production* so that our execution plan reflects the small-account growth objectives, planned multi-exchange expansion, and the UX/agent integration vision captured in that briefing.

Deploy the trading bot on Binance Testnet for extensive validation with multiple instances and configurations to determine the winning strategy.

### Timeline: 2-4 weeks

### Phase 1: Testnet Infrastructure Setup & Service Completion (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Binance Testnet Integration
```java
// Testnet Configuration
@Configuration
public class TestnetConfig {
    @Value("${binance.testnet.api.url:https://testnet.binance.vision}")
    private String testnetApiUrl;
    
    @Value("${binance.testnet.api.key}")
    private String testnetApiKey;
