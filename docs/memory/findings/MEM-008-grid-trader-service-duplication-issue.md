## Summary
Grid trader service duplicates storage service bootstrap classes instead of implementing strategy-specific logic, indicating incomplete implementation

## Details
The binance-trader-grid service appears to duplicate the storage service's bootstrap classes instead of containing strategy-specific logic. This suggests the intended grid trading implementation has not been committed or developed. The service should implement grid trading strategy logic but currently lacks any trading-specific functionality. This creates a gap in the trading strategy portfolio and prevents grid trading from being available as an alternative to MACD trading.

## Recommendations
- Implement actual grid trading strategy logic, Remove duplicated storage service code, Create grid-specific domain models and services, Add grid trading configuration parameters, Implement grid position management, Add grid trading tests and validation

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review and validate finding
- [ ] Implement recommendations
- [ ] Update related documentation
