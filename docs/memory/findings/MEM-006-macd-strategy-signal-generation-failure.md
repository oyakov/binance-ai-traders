## Summary
MACD strategy is not generating any buy/sell signals, resulting in 0 trades across all parameter sets and making the strategy completely non-functional

## Details
Analysis of real data shows that the MACD analyzer is not generating any buy/sell signals, resulting in 0 trades across all parameter sets tested. This suggests insufficient data (30 days might not be enough), signal logic issues (crossover detection too strict), parameter sensitivity problems, or data quality issues. The strategy is trend-dependent and volatility-sensitive, requiring sufficient price movement to generate signals. All parameter sets showed identical results: 0% net profit, 0.00 Sharpe ratio, 0% win rate, 0% max drawdown, and 0 total trades.

## Recommendations
- Debug MACD signal generation with logging, Test with longer time periods (90+ days), Verify EMA calculations are correct, Check signal crossover logic, Add minimum price movement thresholds, Implement signal confirmation logic, Add market condition filters
