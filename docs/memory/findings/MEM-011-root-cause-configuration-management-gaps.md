## Summary

Inconsistent configuration management across services leads to deployment issues and makes the system difficult to operate.

## Details

The root cause of configuration issues stems from inconsistent configuration management across services. Each service has its own configuration approach without standardized patterns. Environment variables are not documented, secrets lack standardized loading, and there's no centralized configuration management. This makes deployment difficult and error-prone, especially for production environments. The lack of configuration validation means issues are only discovered at runtime.

### Configuration Issues Identified
1. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Each service uses different configuration approaches
2. **Undocumented Variables**: Environment variables not documented
3. **Secret Management**: No standardized secret loading
4. **No Validation**: Configuration issues only discovered at runtime
5. **Deployment Complexity**: Difficult to deploy and operate

### Impact
- Difficult and error-prone deployment
- Runtime configuration failures
- Poor operational experience
- High maintenance overhead

## Recommendations

- Implement centralized configuration management
- Standardize environment variable handling
- Create configuration validation framework
- Document all required configuration parameters
- Implement configuration templates for different environments
- Add configuration testing and validation

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement centralized configuration management
- [ ] Standardize configuration patterns
- [ ] Create configuration validation framework
- [ ] Document all configuration parameters
- [ ] Add configuration testing
