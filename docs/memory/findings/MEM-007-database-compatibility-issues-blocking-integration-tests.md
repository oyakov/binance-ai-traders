## Summary
H2 database compatibility problems with PostgreSQL-specific syntax prevent integration tests from running, blocking comprehensive testing

## Details
Integration tests are failing due to database migration problems with SERIAL4 data type incompatibility with H2 database. The V1__create.sql migration file uses PostgreSQL-specific syntax that doesn't work with H2 test database. This prevents Spring Boot context loading and comprehensive testing. The issue affects all services that use database integration tests, blocking validation of complete workflows and end-to-end functionality.

## Recommendations
- Update V1__create.sql migration to use H2-compatible syntax, Replace serial4 with BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT, Change varchar to VARCHAR(255), Replace int8 with BIGINT, Change JSON to CLOB for H2 compatibility, Test migration compatibility across different database types
