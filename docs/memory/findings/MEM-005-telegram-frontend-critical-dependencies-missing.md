## Summary
Python Telegram bot has extensive scaffolding but is completely non-functional due to missing modules and dependencies

## Details
The telegram-frontend-python service has 2,975 statements but only 2% test coverage. Many imports reference modules that don't exist (additional_jobs, subsystems.ai_assistant, db_config, etc.), preventing the application from running. There's no entry point script configuring aiogram/telebot clients despite router scaffolding. Tests are effectively empty, providing no safety net. Configuration management is undocumented with secrets lacking standardized loading. This makes the entire frontend unusable for end users.

## Recommendations
- Audit package for missing modules and restore or adjust imports, Create concrete startup script wiring routers and dependency injection, Add integration tests for bot dry-run mode validation, Document required environment variables and provide sample configuration files
