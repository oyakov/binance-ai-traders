## Summary
Testnet infrastructure exists but lacks real trading integration, making it non-functional for actual strategy validation

## Details
The testnet system has comprehensive infrastructure (TestnetInstanceManager, TestnetTradingInstance, TestnetPerformanceTracker) but critical gaps prevent actual trading execution. The simulateLifecycle() method only contains placeholder sleep loops instead of real trading logic. No integration exists between testnet instances and MACD signal analyzer, no real data collection from Binance testnet, and no actual order execution. This makes the testnet system essentially useless for validating trading strategies before production deployment.

## Recommendations
- Implement real trading integration in TestnetTradingInstance.simulateLifecycle(), Connect testnet instances to MACDSignalAnalyzer and TraderService, Integrate with BinanceHistoricalDataFetcher for real data, Implement actual order placement via BinanceOrderClient, Add trade recording to TestnetPerformanceTracker
