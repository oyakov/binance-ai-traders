## Summary

The project lacks comprehensive testing strategy, leading to critical issues being discovered late in development and preventing reliable deployment.

## Details

The root cause of testing gaps stems from insufficient testing strategy across the project. Python services have only 2% test coverage, integration tests are blocked by database compatibility issues, and there are no end-to-end tests validating complete workflows. The testing approach focuses on individual components rather than system integration, missing critical validation of service interactions. This leads to issues being discovered only when attempting to run the complete system, making development and deployment unreliable.

### Testing Gaps Identified
1. **Python Test Coverage**: Only 2% coverage across 2,975 statements
2. **Integration Test Blocking**: Database compatibility issues prevent integration testing
3. **End-to-End Testing**: No complete workflow validation
4. **Performance Testing**: No load or performance tests
5. **Configuration Testing**: No validation of configuration parameters

### Impact
- Critical issues discovered late in development
- Unreliable deployment and operation
- Poor code quality and maintainability
- High risk of production failures

## Recommendations

- Develop comprehensive testing strategy covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Increase Python test coverage to minimum 70%
- Fix database compatibility issues blocking integration tests
- Implement automated testing pipeline
- Add performance and load testing
- Create testing documentation and guidelines
