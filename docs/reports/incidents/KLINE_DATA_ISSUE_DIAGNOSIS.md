# Kline Data Collection Issue - Diagnosis
**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Issue**: Latest kline data not displayed in Grafana

---

## üîç Problem Observed

From the screenshot:
- **Recent Kline Data Table** shows data from **2025-10-09** (October 9th)
- **Current Date**: October 12, 2025
- **Gap**: ~3 days of missing data
- **Chart Status**: "Data outside time range - Zoom to data"

---

## üìä Possible Causes

### 1. Data Collection Service Stopped ‚ö†Ô∏è
The `binance-data-collection-testnet` service may have crashed or stopped 3 days ago.

### 2. Binance API Issues
- API key rate limits exceeded
- Testnet API temporarily unavailable
- WebSocket connection lost and not reconnected

### 3. Database Issues
- PostgreSQL storage full
- Connection issues between services

### 4. Kafka Issues
- Kafka queue backed up
- Consumer not processing messages

## üîß Manual Diagnostic Steps

Run these commands **one at a time** in PowerShell:

### Step 1: Check Container Status
```powershell
docker ps --filter "name=testnet" --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
```

**Expected**: All containers should show "Up" status  
**Look for**: Any containers with "Restarting" or recently restarted

---

### Step 2: Check Database Content
```powershell
docker exec postgres-testnet psql -U testnet_user -d binance_trader_testnet -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_klines, MAX(display_time) as latest_time, MIN(display_time) as earliest_time FROM kline;"
```

**Expected**: `latest_time` should be close to current time  
**Problem**: If `latest_time` is October 9th, data collection has stopped

---

### Step 3: Check Recent Klines
```powershell
docker exec postgres-testnet psql -U testnet_user -d binance_trader_testnet -c "SELECT symbol, interval, display_time FROM kline ORDER BY display_time DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

**Look for**: Date of most recent entries

---

### Step 4: Check Data Collection Service Logs
```powershell
docker logs binance-data-collection-testnet --tail 50
```

**Look for**:
- ‚úÖ "Successfully fetched klines" messages
- ‚ùå Error messages
- ‚ùå Connection refused
- ‚ùå Rate limit errors
- ‚ùå Authentication errors

---

### Step 5: Check Data Storage Service Logs
```powershell
docker logs binance-data-storage-testnet --tail 50
```

**Look for**:
- ‚úÖ "Saved kline" messages
- ‚ùå Database errors
- ‚ùå Kafka consumer errors

---

### Step 6: Check Kafka Status
```powershell
docker logs kafka-testnet --tail 30
```

**Look for**: Any errors or warnings

## üöë Common Fixes

### Fix 1: Restart Data Collection Service
If the service has stopped:
```powershell
docker-compose -f docker-compose-testnet.yml restart binance-data-collection-testnet
```

Wait 2-3 minutes, then check logs:
```powershell
docker logs binance-data-collection-testnet --tail 20
```

---

### Fix 2: Restart All Services
If multiple services have issues:
```powershell
docker-compose -f docker-compose-testnet.yml restart
```

Wait 5 minutes for all services to stabilize.

---

### Fix 3: Check API Keys
If you see authentication errors:
```powershell
# Check if API keys are set
docker exec binance-data-collection-testnet env | Select-String "BINANCE_API"
```

---

### Fix 4: Clear and Restart (Nuclear Option)
If nothing works:
```powershell
# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose-testnet.yml down

# Start fresh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-testnet.yml up -d

# Wait 5 minutes
Start-Sleep -Seconds 300

# Check status
docker ps --filter "name=testnet"
```

## üéØ Grafana Time Range Issue

If data IS being collected but not showing:

### Check Grafana Time Range
1. Look at top-right of Grafana dashboard
2. Click the time range selector
3. Ensure it's set to recent time (e.g., "Last 1 hour", "Last 6 hours")
4. Try clicking "Zoom to data" on the charts

### Manual Time Range Fix
1. Click time picker in top-right
2. Select "Last 6 hours" or "Last 1 hour"
3. Click "Apply"
4. Refresh dashboard

## üìù Data Collection Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation
- Data collection service fetches klines every 60 seconds
- Klines published to Kafka topic `binance-kline`
- Data storage service consumes from Kafka
- Klines saved to PostgreSQL `kline` table
- New data should appear every ~60 seconds

### Monitoring
```powershell
# Watch logs in real-time (Ctrl+C to stop)
docker logs -f binance-data-collection-testnet
```

You should see messages like:
```
Fetched 100 klines for BTCUSDT 5m
Published kline event to Kafka
```

## üîç Investigation Questions

1. **When did you last see live data?**
   - October 9th based on screenshot

2. **Have you restarted any services recently?**

3. **Are you using Binance Testnet API keys?**
   - Testnet keys from `.env` or `testnet.env`

4. **Is this a fresh setup or has it been running?**
   - Was running for a few days per earlier conversation

5. **Any system changes in last 3 days?**
   - Check if Windows updated
   - Check if Docker restarted
   - Check disk space

## üöÄ Quick Verification After Fix

After applying any fix:

### 1. Wait 2-3 Minutes
Allow services to stabilize and start collecting.

### 2. Check for New Data
```powershell
# Check if new klines are being added
docker exec postgres-testnet psql -U testnet_user -d binance_trader_testnet -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM kline;"

# Wait 60 seconds
Start-Sleep -Seconds 60

# Check again - count should increase
docker exec postgres-testnet psql -U testnet_user -d binance_trader_testnet -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM kline;"
```

### 3. Refresh Grafana
- Go to Grafana dashboard
- Press `Ctrl + F5` to hard refresh
- Change time range to "Last 1 hour"
- Check if data appears

## üìã Diagnostic Checklist

Run through these and report results:

- [ ] All containers running (no restarts)
- [ ] Latest kline data timestamp
- [ ] Data collection service logs show activity
- [ ] Data storage service logs show saves
- [ ] No errors in any service logs
- [ ] Kafka running without errors
- [ ] PostgreSQL accessible
- [ ] Grafana time range set correctly
- [ ] New data appearing after waiting 60 seconds

## üéØ Most Likely Issue

Based on the symptoms (data stopped 3 days ago):

**Hypothesis**: The `binance-data-collection-testnet` service either:
1. Crashed and didn't restart
2. Lost connection to Binance API
3. Encountered a rate limit or auth error

**First Action**: Check service logs and restart if needed

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. Run **Step 1** (check container status)
2. Run **Step 2** (check database - confirm latest data is Oct 9)
3. Run **Step 4** (check data collection logs for errors)
4. Share the output here so I can diagnose further

OR

If you want immediate resolution:
```powershell
# Restart data collection service
docker-compose -f docker-compose-testnet.yml restart binance-data-collection-testnet binance-data-storage-testnet

# Wait and verify
Start-Sleep -Seconds 120

# Check logs
docker logs binance-data-collection-testnet --tail 30
```

---

**Please run the diagnostic steps and share what you find!**
