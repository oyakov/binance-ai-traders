GitHub Actions triggered
    ↓
Build Application (Maven)
    ↓
Run Tests
    ↓

## Next Steps

### 1. Setup GitHub Secrets (30 minutes)

Follow `.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md`:

1. Generate SSH keys for deployment
2. Generate age keys for secrets encryption
3. Add secrets to GitHub repository:
   - `VPS_HOST`: 145.223.70.118
   - `VPS_USER`: binance-trader
   - `VPS_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key
   - `SOPS_AGE_KEY`: age secret key
4. Encrypt environment files
5. Commit encrypted files

### 2. Configure Branch Protection (15 minutes)

Follow `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`:

1. Set up `develop` branch protection (1 approval)
2. Set up `main` branch protection (2 approvals)
3. Create `production` environment with reviewers
4. Enable required status checks

### 3. Test Automatic Deployment (15 minutes)

```bash
# Make a test change
git checkout -b test/cicd-deployment
# Make small change
git commit -m "Test: CI/CD deployment"
git push origin test/cicd-deployment

# Create PR to develop
# After approval, merge to develop
# Watch automatic deployment in Actions tab
```

### 4. Test Manual Production Deployment (20 minutes)

1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Deploy to Production (Manual)"
3. Run workflow with action: `status`
4. Verify it works without actually deploying

### 5. Train Team (1 hour)

Share documentation:
- `.github/CICD_OPERATIONS.md` - How to use CI/CD
- `scripts/deployment/EMERGENCY_COMMANDS.md` - Emergency procedures
- `.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md` - Secrets management

---

## Emergency Procedures

### If GitHub Actions is Down

Use manual deployment scripts:

```powershell
# Full deployment
.\scripts\deployment\manual-deploy-full.ps1 -Environment production

# Quick restart
.\scripts\deployment\quick-restart.ps1 -Environment production

# Rollback
.\scripts\deployment\rollback.ps1 -Environment production

# Diagnostics
.\scripts\deployment\diagnose.ps1 -Environment production -SaveReport
```

### If VPS Needs Rebuild

```bash
# From local machine
scp scripts/deployment/emergency-vps-setup.sh root@145.223.70.118:/tmp/
ssh root@145.223.70.118
bash /tmp/emergency-vps-setup.sh
# Save displayed password!

# Then deploy
.\scripts\deployment\manual-deploy-full.ps1 -Environment production
```
