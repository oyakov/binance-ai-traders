## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **`simple-dashboard.json` is broken** ‚ùå
   - No title, no UID, no panels
   - Causing Grafana errors every 10 seconds
   - **Action**: DELETE immediately

### Overlap/Duplication Issues
2. **Triple MACD Coverage** üîÑ
   - Dashboard #3: MACD Trading Strategies (2 panels)
   - Dashboard #6: MACD Indicators Dashboard (9 panels)
   - Dashboard #9: Trading Strategy Observability (6 panels, **NEW**)
   - **Issue**: 3 dashboards showing similar MACD data
   - **Action**: Consolidate into #9 (most comprehensive)

3. **Minimal Panel Dashboards** üìä
   - Dashboard #2: Trading Operations (2 panels only)
   - Dashboard #5: Trading Analytics (1 panel only)
   - Dashboard #7: Executive Overview (1 panel only)
   - **Issue**: Too few panels to justify separate dashboards
   - **Action**: Merge panels into other dashboards or remove

4. **General Metrics Overlap** üìà
   - Dashboard #12: Comprehensive Metrics (8 panels)
   - Overlaps with multiple other dashboards
   - **Action**: Redistribute panels to specific dashboards

## Consolidation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Deletions (Critical)

#### 1.1 Delete Broken Dashboard ‚ùå
**File**: `binance-trading/simple-dashboard.json`
- **Reason**: Broken, causing errors
- **Impact**: None (not usable)
- **Action**: Delete immediately

```powershell
Remove-Item "monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/binance-trading/simple-dashboard.json"
```

---

### Phase 2: Remove Low-Value Dashboards

#### 2.1 Remove "Trading Analytics & Insights" ‚ùå
**File**: `05-analytics/trading-analytics-insights.json`
- **Panels**: 1 panel only
- **Reason**: Too minimal, data likely available elsewhere
- **Migration**: Check if panel is needed, move to relevant dashboard if yes
- **Impact**: Minimal

#### 2.2 Remove "Executive Overview" ‚ùå
**File**: `06-executive/executive-overview.json`
- **Panels**: 1 panel only
- **Reason**: Too minimal for separate dashboard
- **Migration**: Create "Executive" folder in Grafana UI and star important dashboards instead
- **Impact**: Minimal (create bookmark collection instead)

---

### Phase 3: Consolidate MACD Dashboards

#### 3.1 Keep as Primary: "Trading Strategy Observability" ‚úÖ
**File**: `08-observability/strategy-observability-dashboard.json`
- **Why Keep**: Most comprehensive, newest, includes:
  - MACD calculations
  - Signal detection
  - Portfolio tracking
  - Event history
- **Action**: Enhance with best panels from others

#### 3.2 Deprecate: "MACD Trading Strategies" ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File**: `03-macd-strategies/macd-trading-strategies.json`
- **Panels**: 2 panels only
- **Reason**: Superseded by Trading Strategy Observability
- **Migration**: Verify panels aren't unique, then delete
- **Impact**: Low (data available in #9)

#### 3.3 Deprecate: "MACD Indicators Dashboard" ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File**: `05-macd-indicators/macd-indicators-dashboard.json`
- **Panels**: 9 panels
- **Reason**: Overlaps with Trading Strategy Observability
- **Migration**: Extract unique panels, add to Observability dashboard
- **Impact**: Medium (check for unique visualizations first)

---

### Phase 4: Consolidate General Dashboards

#### 4.1 Evaluate "Comprehensive Metrics Dashboard" ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File**: `binance-trading/comprehensive-metrics-dashboard.json`
- **Panels**: 8 panels
- **Decision**: Check if panels duplicate existing dashboards
- **Actions**:
  - If unique: Keep as "General Metrics"
  - If duplicate: Distribute panels to specific dashboards
  - Rename folder from "binance-trading" to numbered folder

#### 4.2 Merge "Trading Operations Overview" ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File**: `02-trading-overview/trading-operations-overview.json`
- **Panels**: 2 panels only
- **Reason**: Too minimal
- **Migration**: Move panels to "Order & Profitability Monitoring"
- **Impact**: Low
