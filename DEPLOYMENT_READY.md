## 🎬 What Happens When You Deploy

### Phase 1: Local Setup (Your Windows Machine)
1. ✅ Generates SSH keys (ED25519)
2. ✅ Creates VPS setup script (auto-generated)
3. ✅ Generates age encryption keys
4. ✅ Creates strong passwords & API keys
5. ✅ Encrypts secrets with SOPS
6. ✅ Uploads everything to VPS

### Phase 2: VPS Setup (145.223.70.118)
1. ✅ Updates system (CentOS 9.3)
2. ✅ Installs Docker CE
3. ✅ Installs fail2ban, firewalld
4. ✅ Creates deployment user (binance-trader)
5. ✅ Configures firewall (blocks all except 80, 443, 22)
6. ✅ Sets up SSH keys
7. ✅ Creates application directory

### Phase 3: Application Deployment
1. ✅ Decrypts secrets
2. ✅ Generates TLS certificates
3. ✅ Pulls Docker images
4. ✅ Builds custom images
5. ✅ Starts all services:
   - Nginx (reverse proxy)
   - PostgreSQL
   - Elasticsearch
   - Kafka
   - Prometheus
   - Grafana
   - binance-trader-macd
   - binance-data-collection
   - binance-data-storage
   - health-metrics-server

### Phase 4: Verification
1. ✅ Checks all containers running
2. ✅ Tests health endpoints
3. ✅ Verifies firewall rules
4. ✅ Confirms monitoring active
