2. **Code Maintainability**: Well-structured and documented
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new strategies and metrics

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Fix Database Issues**
   - Resolve `SERIAL4` compatibility with H2
   - Ensure all integration tests pass
   - Implement proper database migration strategy

2. **Strategy Optimization**
   - Analyze MACD parameter sensitivity
   - Implement parameter optimization framework
   - Test across different market conditions

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Enhanced Risk Management**
   - Implement position sizing algorithms
   - Add transaction cost modeling
   - Improve stop-loss and take-profit logic

2. **Performance Monitoring**
