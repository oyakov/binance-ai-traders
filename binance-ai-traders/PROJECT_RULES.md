# Binance AI Traders - Project Rules & Core Features

## üéØ Project Overview

**Binance AI Traders** is a comprehensive automated trading system for Binance cryptocurrency exchange, featuring advanced backtesting, real-time data collection, and multiple trading strategies. The system is built as a microservices architecture with Java/Spring Boot backend services and a Python Telegram frontend.

### Current Project Status
- **M0 (Backtesting Engine)**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Full backtesting engine with 2,400+ test scenarios
- **M1 (Testnet Launch)**: üöß **IN PROGRESS** - Multi-instance testnet validation phase
- **M2 (Production Launch)**: üìã **PLANNED** - Low-budget production deployment

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture Rules

### 1. Microservices Architecture
- **Rule**: All services must be independently deployable and loosely coupled
- **Implementation**: Each service has its own Docker container and configuration
- **Communication**: Services communicate via Kafka events using Avro schemas
- **Dependencies**: Services depend on `binance-shared-model` for shared contracts

### 2. Service Dependencies
