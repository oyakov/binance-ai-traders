**Impact Scope**: global-architecture,service-integration  

## Summary

The project suffers from incomplete service integration due to missing core implementations and lack of end-to-end workflow validation.

## Details

The root cause of many critical issues stems from incomplete service integration architecture. Services were developed in isolation without proper integration testing, leading to missing connections between components. The data collection service lacks WebSocket implementation, trading services lack real strategy logic, and the frontend lacks proper dependency management. This architectural gap prevents the system from functioning as a cohesive trading platform. The lack of comprehensive integration testing means issues are only discovered when attempting to run the complete system.

### Key Integration Gaps
1. **Data Flow Disruption**: Data collection service cannot feed data to trading services
2. **Service Communication**: Missing Kafka integration between services
3. **Frontend Integration**: Telegram bot cannot communicate with backend services
4. **Strategy Execution**: Trading strategies cannot execute due to missing data and integration

### Impact
- System cannot function as intended
- Critical features are non-functional
- Development and testing are blocked
- Production deployment is impossible

## Recommendations

- Implement comprehensive integration testing framework
- Create end-to-end workflow validation
- Establish service integration patterns
- Add integration test coverage for all service interactions
- Implement proper dependency injection across services
- Create integration test data and scenarios
