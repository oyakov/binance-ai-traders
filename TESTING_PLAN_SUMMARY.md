## 🎓 Best Practices

1. **Always run health checks first** - Quick validation before deeper testing
2. **Archive test reports** - Keep historical data for trend analysis
3. **Run from repository root** - All scripts expect this location
4. **Document new issues** - Update memory system with findings
5. **Automate where possible** - Use provided scripts for consistency
6. **Review logs on failure** - Detailed logs are in test-reports/
7. **Test after changes** - Validate before committing
8. **Monitor resources** - Ensure adequate CPU, memory, disk
