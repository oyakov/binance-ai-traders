# Milestone Status Review

## Milestone Guidance Overview
- **M0 – Backtesting Engine:** Completed with extensive analytics, multi-symbol support, and risk metrics based on the roadmap summary. 【F:MILESTONE_GUIDE.md†L9-L34】
- **M1 – Testnet Launch Alpha Testing:** Requires dedicated testnet configuration, multi-instance orchestration, strategy profile management, monitoring, and multi-week validation to confirm profitable strategies before production. 【F:MILESTONE_GUIDE.md†L38-L155】【F:M1_TESTNET_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L9-L198】
- **M2 – Low-Budget Production Launch:** Depends on a successful M1 outcome and adds production-specific configuration, security hardening, monitoring, and controlled capital deployment. 【F:MILESTONE_GUIDE.md†L158-L200】【F:M2_PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L9-L103】

## Current System State Assessment
- **Repository composition:** The monorepo already delivers data collection, storage, indicator calculation, trading strategies, and a Telegram bot wired together through Kafka, illustrating a robust pre-testnet pipeline. 【F:README.md†L1-L176】
- **Backtesting capabilities:** The MACD trader module contains a full-featured backtesting engine with dataset loaders, analysis utilities, and metrics calculators, aligning with the completed M0 milestone. 【F:binance-trader-macd/src/main/java/com/oyakov/binance_trader_macd/backtest/BacktestEngine.java†L1-L36】【81322b†L1-L14】
- **Testnet readiness gaps:** Runtime configuration only exposes generic `application-mainnet.yml` and `application-testnet.yml` profiles without the dedicated Spring beans, instance manager, or strategy profile loader envisioned for M1. 【F:binance-trader-macd/src/main/resources/application-testnet.yml†L1-L69】【F:binance-trader-macd/src/main/java/com/oyakov/binance_trader_macd/config/MACDTraderConfig.java†L1-L51】【7d1b37†L1-L3】【a464a9†L1-L3】
- **Production readiness gaps:** No production profile, key-management utilities, or hardened risk/monitoring services exist yet, so M2 prerequisites remain unaddressed pending M1 completion. 【F:M2_PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L9-L103】【7d1b37†L1-L3】【a464a9†L1-L3】

## Gap Analysis vs. Milestones
1. **M0:** Functional backtesting engine matches milestone deliverables; focus now shifts to live validation.
2. **M1:** Missing elements include:
   - Spring `@Profile("testnet")` configuration and Binance testnet order client bean. 【F:M1_TESTNET_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L11-L33】
   - Multi-instance orchestration services and performance tracking infrastructure. 【F:M1_TESTNET_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L58-L125】
   - Externalized strategy profiles (`testnet-strategies.yml`) and loader to drive parameter variations. 【F:M1_TESTNET_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L128-L198】
   - Monitoring dashboards and reporting across the multi-week soak test. 【F:MILESTONE_GUIDE.md†L103-L155】
3. **M2:** Cannot proceed until M1 validation is in place; additional security, monitoring, and budget controls are still conceptual only. 【F:MILESTONE_GUIDE.md†L158-L200】【F:M2_PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L9-L103】

## Recommended Next Tasks
1. **Implement testnet Spring profile support** with a dedicated configuration class that provisions Binance testnet clients and toggles behavior via `application-testnet.yml`. 【F:M1_TESTNET_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L11-L56】
2. **Build the multi-instance testnet controller** (manager, trading instance wrapper, performance tracker) plus persistence for per-instance metrics. 【F:M1_TESTNET_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L58-L125】
3. **Introduce strategy profile management** by defining `testnet-strategies.yml`, parsing it into strongly-typed configs, and wiring it into instance startup. 【F:M1_TESTNET_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L128-L198】
4. **Create real-time monitoring and alerting** (dashboards, metrics exports, anomaly detection) to satisfy M1 reporting expectations. 【F:MILESTONE_GUIDE.md†L103-L155】
5. **Develop automated soak-testing workflows** that run multiple instances for multi-week spans with logging, failure recovery, and consolidated reporting to establish the M1 success criteria. 【F:MILESTONE_GUIDE.md†L117-L148】
6. **Prepare production hardening blueprints** (API key management, rate limiting, capital controls) so they can be implemented rapidly once a winning strategy emerges from M1. 【F:M2_PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L9-L103】

These actions progress the project from completed backtesting (M0) toward the live validation and control layers required for M1, unlocking the path to the M2 production pilot once testnet evidence is in place.
